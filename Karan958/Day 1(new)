Learned about Format Specifier, constant and escape sequence

#include <stdio.h>
#define PI 3.14
int main()

{
    /* code */
int a=8;
const float b=7.333;
// PI = b; cannot do this sinbce pi is constant
printf("My backslash is // ",PI);

// b=7.22 connot do this since b is a constant
//printf("Hello World\n");    
//printf("The value of a is %d and the value of b is %.4f\n",a,b);
    return 0;
}
